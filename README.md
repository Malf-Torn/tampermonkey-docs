# Tampermonkey Scripts - Documentation

Welcome! This repository contains the documentation and screenshots for my Tampermonkey scripts. This repository serves as a manual on how to use and configure them.

## 📂 Available Script Guides

Here you can find the detailed instructions for each script:

* **[Disable Forum Like Buttons](./disable-forum-like-buttons/README.md)**  
  *Completely hides the Like and Dislike buttons in the forums. This reliably prevents accidental clicks and saves you from unnecessary drama with sensitive players.*

* **[Disable Stock Benefit Block Selling](./disable-stock-benefit-block-selling/README.md)**  
  *Prevents you from accidentally selling shares and protects your stock benefit blocks.*

* **[Revive Contract Helper](./revive-contract-helper/README.md)**  
  *Manages revive contracts, prevents accidental revives, and optimizes the UI for maximum speed.*

**Feedback & Support:** If you find any bugs or have feature requests, just shoot me a message!
