# Disable Forum Like Buttons

A straightforward Tampermonkey script for Torn that completely removes the Like and Dislike buttons from all forum posts. This tool is designed to save you from accidental misclicks while scrolling and the unnecessary drama that can sometimes follow an accidental downvote.

## Features

* **Accident Prevention:** Completely hides both the "Like" and "Dislike" buttons on all forum posts.
* **Zero Configuration:** Install and forget. There are no settings or menus to manage.

## How It Works

The script constantly monitors the forum pages in the background. As soon as a post renders, it applies a hidden style to the buttons before you can interact with them. 

## Bypassing the Script

Because the goal is absolute prevention, **there is no temporary toggle or in-game configuration menu** for this script. 

If you encounter a post that you genuinely want to like or dislike, you need to temporary disable this script.
